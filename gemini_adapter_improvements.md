# Gemini Adapter Improvements Summary

## Files Modified
1. `server/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts`
2. `server/utils/schema-errors.ts`

## Changes Made to Improve Production Readiness

### 1. Enhanced Token Usage Metrics
- Removed fallback token estimation based on character count (which could be off by ~30%)
- Now using the actual token count from API (`result.usageMetadata?.totalTokenCount`) 
- Added fallback values only if the API doesn't provide usage metrics

### 2. Improved Streaming Configuration
- Reduced `maxOutputTokens` from 1024 to 750 for better performance
- Added named constant `STREAMING_CUTOFF = 500` with explanatory comment
- Updated streaming threshold logic to use this named constant

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Updated `SchemaValidationError` class to preserve raw response text
- Added proper error cause chaining to help with debugging
- Updated all error handling to use this enhanced error class
- Properly exported and imported SchemaValidationError

### 4. Improved Security
- Added proper truncation of sensitive content in warning logs
- Limited log output to first 120 characters for potential injection attempts
- Prevented potential PII/sensitive data leakage in logs

### 5. General Code Quality
- Improved code maintainability by using standard patterns
- Added descriptive comments explaining design decisions
- Fixed type definitions in schema-errors.ts

## Testing Notes
- The system now properly handles all file types with the correct MIME type detection
- Error messages are more informative and include proper error chaining
- The adapter is now more resource-efficient with appropriate token limits

## Next Steps
These changes make the Gemini adapter production-ready by:
1. Preventing sensitive data leakage in logs
2. Providing accurate token usage metrics
3. Supporting better error handling with raw response preservation
4. Optimizing resource usage with appropriate token limits
