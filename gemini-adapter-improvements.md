# Gemini Adapter Improvements

## Summary of Changes Implemented

We have successfully implemented several key improvements to the Gemini adapter:

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
   - Created a shared `runImageRubric` helper method that handles the common API call logic
   - Both `generateCompletion` and `generateMultimodalCompletion` now use this helper
   - Improves maintainability and ensures consistent handling

2. **Token Budget Management**
   - Implemented a two-step token budget approach with constants:
     - `BASE_MAX_TOKENS = 1200` (first attempt)
     - `RETRY_MAX_TOKENS = 1600` (retry if finishReason !== "STOP")
   - Removed token count fallbacks that could lead to inaccurate billing data

3. **Streaming Optimization**
   - Removed all `STREAMING_CUTOFF` logic and conditional branches
   - All API calls now consistently use streaming for better response handling
   - The adapter now correctly tracks and uses finish reasons to determine when to retry

4. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Better tracking of finish reasons from streaming responses
   - More informative error messages with specific details about what went wrong
   - Improved retry logic when responses are truncated

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **SDK Helper Methods**
   - When upgrading to the latest SDK version (0.15.0+), we can use the new `types.Part.fromFile()` helper method to handle file data conversion automatically
   - This would eliminate the need for our custom snake_case conversion and improve compatibility

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Improve TypeScript type definitions and interface implementations
   - Ensure full compatibility with the AIAdapter interface requirements

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Add more sophisticated error recovery strategies beyond just retrying with more tokens
   - Implement backoff strategies for rate limiting and service unavailability

## Testing Strategy

To validate the improvements, test the following scenarios:

1. Text-only submissions with different prompt sizes
2. Image submissions, especially large images that require the Files API
3. Multimodal submissions with combinations of text and images
4. Verify that tokens are counted correctly and no fallback values are used
5. Ensure proper retry behavior when responses are truncated

## Impact on Production

These changes should lead to:

- More reliable handling of large responses
- Fewer failures due to token limitations
- Consistent and predictable behavior across all request types
- Better maintainability for future developers
- More accurate token counting and billing information
