We've built a robust and functional AIGrader platform with a strong technical foundation. Now, our focus shifts to transforming it into a truly polished, intuitive, and top-tier web application that delights users and reflects the premium quality of an MIT-affiliated tool. This means going beyond core functionality to refine every user interaction, enhance visual consistency with the MIT brand, and implement thoughtful details that make the platform feel seamless, professional, and exceptionally user-friendly. We're aiming for an experience that's not just usable, but one that instills confidence and makes the process of submitting assignments and receiving AI feedback feel both sophisticated and effortless for students, instructors, and administrators alike. We're now going to starting working on this. The following suggestions are geared towards achieving this next level of polish and user-centric design.

Enhancing Visual Polish & Branding Consistency:
Microinteractions & Animations:
Subtle Hover Effects: Apply refined hover effects to buttons, links, cards, and navigation items. This could be a slight change in background color, a subtle shadow lift, or an icon animation. Tailwind provides utilities for transitions (transition-colors duration-200 is already used in index.css for buttons, which is good).
Smooth Transitions: Use the existing keyframes in tailwind.config.ts (like fade-in, slide-up) for page transitions or when new content sections appear. This can make the app feel more dynamic and less abrupt. Ensure these are used judiciously to avoid overwhelming the user.
Loading States: Beyond basic spinners, consider more engaging loading states:
Skeleton Screens (Shadcn UI): For dashboards or content-heavy areas, use skeleton loaders that mimic the layout of the content being loaded. This improves perceived performance. Shadcn UI likely has skeleton components or they can be easily built.
Button Loading States: When a button triggers an async action (e.g., "Submit Assignment," "Save Changes"), disable the button and show an inline spinner within it.
