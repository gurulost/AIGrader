Bugs, Issues, and Areas for Improvement:

Top Navigation Redundancy & Clarity:

Issue: The text link "notifications" next to the bell icon for notifications is redundant.
Fix: Remove the text link "notifications". The icon is standard and sufficient. Tooltips on icons are good for accessibility and clarity.
Issue: "help outline" is unclear. Is it help for the outline feature, or an outline of help topics? The wording is ambiguous. "Help" or "Support" would be more standard.
Fix: Rename "help outline" to "Help" or "Support." Consider if this should be an icon too, or part of the "More" dropdown or user menu.
Left Sidebar Navigation Duplication & Inconsistency:

Issue: The selected "Dashboard" link in the left sidebar reads "dashboard Dashboard". The icon name ("dashboard") seems to be prepended to the label ("Dashboard"). This is likely a bug in how the navigation items are rendered or how their labels are defined.
Fix: Ensure only the intended label (e.g., "Dashboard") is displayed. The icon should be separate. This pattern of icon_name Label is repeated for all sidebar items: "assignment My Assignments", "history Submission History", "settings Settings".
Fix: Correct the label generation for all sidebar navigation items to only display the proper text label (e.g., "My Assignments," "Submission History," "Settings").
Consideration: The sidebar title "AI Assignment Feedback" is the same as the main platform title in the top bar. This is acceptable but could be simplified if space is a concern or for a cleaner look (e.g., just the user info and nav items).
User Profile Section in Sidebar:

Good: Clear display of user initials, name, and role.
Main Content - "Active Assignments" Section:

Issue (Potential Data/Logic Bug): It says "No active assignments" and "There are no assignments currently available for you." This could be correct if the "Test Student" truly has no active assignments. However, if there should be assignments, this indicates:
A bug in the backend API (GET /api/assignments for students) not returning assignments.
A bug in the frontend data fetching or filtering logic.
The student might not be enrolled in any courses that have active assignments.
Fix/Investigation Needed:
Verify the backend API (GET /api/assignments when logged in as "Test Student") is returning the correct data. The API is designed to return assignments the student is enrolled in and their latest submission status.
Check the frontend component responsible for fetching and displaying active assignments. Ensure it's calling the correct endpoint and handling the response (including empty states) correctly.
Confirm "Test Student" is properly enrolled in courses with assignments that are currently "active" (i.e., status: 'active' and dueDate is in the future).
Visuals: The large "assignment" icon and text are clear for an empty state.
Main Content - "Submission History" Section:

Issue (Potential Data/Logic Bug): It says "No submissions yet." Similar to active assignments, this could be correct or indicate a bug.
The backend API GET /api/submissions/recent or GET /api/submissions should provide this data.
Fix/Investigation Needed:
Verify the backend API is returning submissions if "Test Student" has made any.
Check the frontend component for fetching and displaying submission history.
Text Inconsistency/Clarity: "Submit your assignment to receive AI feedback" is a good call to action if there are truly no submissions. However, the section title is "Submission History." If there are assignments but no submissions, the primary call to action should probably be on the assignments themselves.
Visuals: The large "history" icon is clear for an empty state.
General UI/UX & Consistency:

Empty State Messaging: The empty state messages are generally okay, but could be more engaging or provide clearer next steps (e.g., in "Active Assignments," if empty, it could say "No assignments are currently active. Check the 'My Assignments' page for all your assignments or contact your instructor.").
"More" Dropdown: What's in it? Ensure it contains relevant but less frequently accessed items.
Overall Layout: The two-column layout with a fixed sidebar and main content area is a standard and generally good approach.
Branding: "AI Feedback Platform" and "AI Assignment Feedback" are used. Consistent branding is good. "University Portal" subtitle in the sidebar clarifies context.
Underlying Data Flow for Dashboard:

The dashboard, as shown, seems to intend to provide a summary. The backend routes (GET /api/assignments for student context, and GET /api/submissions/recent) are designed to provide exactly this kind of summary information.
The issue is likely either:
No actual data for "Test Student": This student has no active assignments they are enrolled in or has made no submissions. This is a data setup issue for testing, not a bug in the dashboard per se, though the empty state messaging could always be improved.
A bug in the frontend components: The components responsible for fetching data from /api/assignments (with student context) or /api/submissions/recent might have an issue, or are not correctly filtering/displaying the data.
A bug in the backend API: Less likely if other parts of the app work, but the specific logic for students in GET /api/assignments could have a bug.
