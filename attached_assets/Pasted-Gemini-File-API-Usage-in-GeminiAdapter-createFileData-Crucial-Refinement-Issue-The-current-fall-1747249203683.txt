Gemini File API Usage in GeminiAdapter.createFileData (Crucial Refinement):

Issue: The current fallback in GeminiAdapter.createFileData to create a data URI and use it as fileData.fileUri needs to be carefully evaluated. While data URIs can be used for inlineData for images, the fileData.fileUri field in a prompt part is typically meant for URIs returned by the Gemini File API (e.g., files/XXX) or supported cloud storage (like gs://...). Directly using a lengthy data URI in fileData.fileUri might not be the intended or most efficient way to use the File API's slot.
Updated Fix Instruction: "AI Coder, in server/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts, the createFileData(content: Buffer, mimeType: string) method is responsible for preparing files for the Gemini API. Primary Path:
Ensure it correctly uses this.generativeAI.uploadFile({ file: { data: content, mimeType: mimeType }}) (or the equivalent method in your SDK version, like this.generativeAI.createFile) to upload the file buffer directly to the Gemini File API.
The successful response from uploadFile will contain a file.uri (e.g., files/your-file-id). This is the URI that should be used in the fileData: { mimeType, fileUri } part of the prompt sent to generateContent. Fallback for uploadFile Failure:
If the uploadFile call itself fails (e.g., API error, unsupported type by File API despite being in SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES), log this error.
For Images (and only images if they are small enough): If the File API upload fails for an image and it's reasonably small (e.g., under 2MB-4MB, check Gemini limits for inline data), you can fall back to providing the image as inlineData: { mimeType, data: content.toString('base64') }.
For Other File Types (PDFs, Videos, Audio, Large Images): If uploadFile fails for these, a data URI in fileData.fileUri is unlikely to work as a robust replacement for a File API URI. In this scenario:
Log a warning that the binary content could not be processed via the File API.
If textContent was extracted (e.g., from a PDF by processFileForMultimodal), the AI prompt should proceed using only this textContent.
If no textContent is available, the prompt should clearly state that the binary content of the specified mimeType could not be analyzed by the AI. Avoid sending a potentially malformed or unsupported fileData part.
The goal is to always prefer the Gemini File API for non-text files and have a graceful degradation path if that API call fails, rather than constructing a fileData part that the generateContent API might not interpret correctly.
