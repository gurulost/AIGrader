Beneath the Surface: Fish and the Waters of Saudi Arabia

Yusuf still remembered the first time his grandfather took him fishing along the Red Sea coast near Jeddah. The morning sun broke gently over the water, casting golden streaks that shimmered like spilled coins. He had only been ten then, and he barely understood the wealth that lay hidden beneath the waves. Now, two decades later, Yusuf was a marine biologist, returning to these same shores to document the delicate ecosystems of Saudi Arabia’s marine life.

Saudi Arabia may be known for its deserts, but the kingdom is bordered by two remarkable bodies of water: the Red Sea to the west and the Arabian Gulf to the east. These waters teem with marine life—more than 1,200 species of fish have been documented in the Red Sea alone, about 170 of which are endemic. For centuries, fishing was both sustenance and culture for coastal communities like Yusuf’s. But as Yusuf quickly learned in his studies, those traditions were being tested by climate change, overfishing, and rapid coastal development.

One fish that held particular fascination for him was the hamour, or grouper, a staple in Saudi cuisine and often served grilled with lemon and spices. In his grandfather’s day, hamour were caught in abundance. But now, Yusuf rarely found large ones in local markets. Their populations had dwindled under the weight of demand. In the eastern city of Dammam, fishermen spoke of how they now had to go farther and deeper to catch even half of what they used to.

Yet not all the stories were grim. On a research dive near the Farasan Islands—a marine protected area in the southern Red Sea—Yusuf encountered a kaleidoscope of coral gardens and darting anthias. The local fishing cooperative had partnered with scientists and government agencies to limit catch sizes and rotate fishing grounds. It was working. Fish populations were beginning to stabilize, and coral health was improving, suggesting that sustainable fishing might not only be a dream but a path forward.

Still, the biggest surprise came not from under the sea, but from inland. In places like Al-Kharj and Al-Qassim, far from the ocean, Saudi Arabia had quietly become a leader in aquaculture. Giant indoor tanks, controlled by advanced water filtration systems and precise feeding regimens, now raised tilapia, sea bream, and even shrimp. Yusuf visited one of these farms and was stunned by its scale. “We want to feed the kingdom without emptying the sea,” the farm manager told him. “The fish here might not swim wild, but they give us breathing room to let the ocean recover.”

Back on the coast, Yusuf cast his line into the water once more, not just as a scientist, but as a grandson returning to a legacy. The sea whispered beneath him—not with nostalgia, but with possibility. Fish in Saudi Arabia were not just a source of food; they were a measure of stewardship, of how a desert nation could learn to live with the rhythms of the sea.
