Addressing "Error 2: File Data Format Issue"

Positive Change (Potentially):
The imports createFileData, GeminiFileData, toSDKFormat from ../utils/gemini-file-handler (line 19) suggest that logic for handling file uploads to the Gemini File API and formatting the parts correctly has been abstracted.
createFileData and toSDKFormat are particularly interesting.
createFileData likely encapsulates uploading the file to the Gemini File API and returning an object (perhaps GeminiFileData) that contains the necessary fileUri string and mimeType.
toSDKFormat might then take these MultimodalPromptPart objects (which would now contain a valid fileUri string for appropriate types after createFileData has run) and convert them into the exact Part[] structure the Gemini SDK expects.
Location of Change (generateMultimodalCompletion around line 208):
We need to see how these new utilities are used within the loop that processes parts: MultimodalPromptPart[] (around line 218).
Previous Problem: The error indicated that fileUri was being treated as an object.
Expected Fix within generateMultimodalCompletion:
The parts array passed into generateMultimodalCompletion should now contain MultimodalPromptPart objects where, for documents/audio/video, the content field IS the string fileUri (e.g., files/YOUR_FILE_ID) obtained from a prior call to the Gemini File API (which createFileData might now be handling upstream).
Or, if createFileData is meant to be called within the adapter for each part (less likely for an adapter's direct responsibility but possible), it needs to ensure its output for the fileUri field is a string.
The key is that the apiParts.push({ fileData: { mimeType: ..., fileUri: fileUriString } }) (around line 236) receives a fileUriString that is definitely a string.
Status: If the gemini-file-handler utilities correctly ensure that:
Files (PDFs, videos, audio, large images) are first uploaded to the Gemini File API.
The string URI from that Gemini File API upload is then used when constructing the fileData.fileUri field. ...then Error 2 should be resolved. The responsibility for this might be split: AIService or the queue worker uses something like createFileData to get the Gemini File URI, and then gemini-adapter-10.ts uses toSDKFormat or directly constructs the Part using that string URI.
