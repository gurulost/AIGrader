The primary purpose of the Admin Dashboard is to provide a centralized control panel for managing the overall configuration, user access (specifically instructor roles if not entirely managed by LTI context), and operational health of the AI Feedback Tool. It ensures the system runs smoothly, securely, and can be adapted to evolving institutional needs.
Key capabilities would include:
1. User and Role Management: While Auth0 will handle the primary authentication, the Admin Dashboard might need to manage application-specific roles or permissions if they go beyond what LTI or basic Auth0 roles provide. This could involve viewing a list of users who have accessed the tool, assigning or confirming "Instructor" privileges within the tool (if not automatically granted based on LTI context for all courses), and potentially managing high-level administrative users for the tool itself. The ability to generate secure launch URLs for courses/assignments, as mentioned in Version O, would also fall under this, allowing admins to set up the initial connections for instructors.
2. System Configuration and Integration Management: This is a critical area. The dashboard should allow administrators to manage essential settings, such as API keys for the AI model (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT-4o), base URLs for LTI integration, and potentially global default parameters for AI feedback (e.g., default strictness, areas of focus, unless these are purely assignment-specific). It would also be the place to manage settings related to the database connection, object storage, and any other third-party services the application relies on.
3. Monitoring, Logging, and Troubleshooting: Admins need tools to ensure the system is operating correctly and to diagnose issues. This includes access to comprehensive audit logs (as mandated in Version G) which track significant events like LTI launches, submissions, AI interactions, and administrative changes. Dashboards showing system health, API call success/failure rates, and resource usage (if applicable) would be invaluable. Functionality to test connections to the LMS or AI service could also be included.
4. Content and Policy Management (Potentially Advanced): Depending on the tool's evolution, admins might need to manage global content templates, default rubric structures if the system supports them, or set institution-wide policies regarding data retention or PII scrubbing rules that complement the default AI model policies. They might also oversee the approved list of AI models or versions that can be used.
Essentially, the Admin Dashboard empowers designated personnel to oversee the technical and operational aspects of the AI Feedback Tool, ensuring its security, reliability, and proper integration within the broader educational technology ecosystem. It provides control over who can do what, how the system connects to other services, and offers visibility into its performance and activity.
