step-by-step guide for your AI Coder:

1. Deep Dive into server/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts

This file is critical for how your application interacts with the Gemini API for multimedia content.

Investigate createFileData and handleFileUploadFailure Methods:

Gemini File API Usage (Primary Concern): The createFileData method attempts to upload files to the Gemini File API. This is the recommended approach for most files, especially images, PDFs, audio, and video.
Action: Verify that files (especially images) are successfully uploaded to the Gemini File API.
Guidance: The fileUri returned by a successful Gemini File API upload (e.g., files/your-file-id) is what should be used in the fileData part of the prompt sent to generateContent. Ensure this URI is correctly obtained and used. Review the logic for this.model.createFile, this.generativeAI.createFile, and this.generativeAI.createBlob.
Reference: Gemini API - Files
Fallback to inlineData for Images:
The code has a fallback to use inlineData (base64 encoded) if the File API upload fails for images (specifically, if createFileData returns an object with useInlineData: true or if handleFileUploadFailure is invoked for an image).
Issue: The useInlineData flag in the object returned by createFileData doesn't seem to be explicitly used in generateMultimodalCompletion to switch to an inlineData part. Instead, it seems generateMultimodalCompletion always expects createFileData to return something usable in a fileData part, or handleFileUploadFailure is called.
Action: Clarify this logic. If createFileData fails to get a fileUri for an image:
Small Images: For images under Gemini's inline data limit (around 4MB, but verify current limits), convert the image buffer to a valid base64 string and use it in an inlineData part: { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/jpeg", data: "base64_string" } }. The addInlineImagePart method seems to handle this conversion and validation. Ensure it's correctly invoked in the fallback path.
Large Images: If the File API fails for a large image, inlineData is not suitable. The system should not attempt to send it inline.
Guidance: Ensure the validateImageBuffer and validateBase64Image methods are robust in catching corrupted or malformed image data before attempting to send it to the API, whether via File API or inline.
Error Handling in createFileData:
Action: Enhance logging within createFileData to capture specific errors if the Gemini File API upload fails. This will give clearer insight than the generic "difficulty processing" message.
Review generateMultimodalCompletion Method:

Prompt Construction:
Action: Log the exact contentParts array being sent to this.model.generateContent(). This is crucial for debugging.
Guidance: Ensure that for images, the Part object is correctly formatted:
If using the File API: { fileData: { mimeType: "image/jpeg", fileUri: "files/your-file-id" } }
If using inline data (small images only as fallback): { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/jpeg", data: "base64_string" } }
Supported MIME Types:
Action: Double-check that the mimeType being sent for images in the Part object (e.g., "image/jpeg", "image/png") exactly matches one of the supported MIME types for image understanding by Gemini.
Guidance: The SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES.image array in gemini-adapter.ts should be kept up-to-date with the official Gemini documentation.
The isMimeTypeSupported method should be correctly utilized.
2. Verify File Processing in server/utils/multimodal-processor.ts

MIME Type Detection (determineContentType, getContentTypeFromMimeType in file-type-settings.ts):
Action: Ensure that when an image is uploaded, its MIME type is correctly identified and passed through the system.
Guidance: While the current MIME detection seems robust, for image submissions that fail, log the detected mimeType and contentType early in the processing pipeline (e.g., in server/routes.ts when the file is first received).
File Content Integrity:
Action: Ensure that the image file buffer (req.file.buffer from Multer) is not corrupted or unintentionally altered before being passed to the GeminiAdapter.
Guidance: If processFileForMultimodal is involved for images (e.g., if they could come from a URL), ensure it correctly handles image data without modification if no specific processing (like text extraction) is needed.
