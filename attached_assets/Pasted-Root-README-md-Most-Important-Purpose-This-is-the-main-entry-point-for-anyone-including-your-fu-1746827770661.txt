Root README.md (Most Important)

Purpose: This is the main entry point for anyone (including your future self or another developer/AI) looking at the project. It should provide a high-level overview.
Content Ideas:
Project Title: AIGrader - AI-Powered Assignment Feedback Tool
Brief Description: What the project does (1-2 sentences). Refer to.
Core Features: List the main capabilities (student submission, AI feedback, instructor dashboard, admin panel).
Tech Stack Overview: Briefly list the main technologies used (React, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, BullMQ, TailwindCSS, Vite, Vitest). Refer to.
Getting Started / Setup Instructions:
Prerequisites (Node.js version, pnpm/npm/yarn, PostgreSQL, Redis if ENABLE_REDIS=true).
How to clone the repository.
How to install dependencies (npm install or similar, based on your package.json scripts).
Environment variables setup: Explain that an .env file is needed and list crucial variables (e.g., DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, CSRF_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, REDIS_URL or REDIS_HOST/PORT, ENABLE_REDIS). Mention if an .env.example file exists or should be created. The project brief mentions updating .env.example.
How to run database migrations (e.g., npm run db:push from your package.json).
How to run the application in development mode (npm run dev).
Available Scripts: Briefly explain the main npm scripts in package.json (e.g., dev, build, start, check, db:push, and test scripts).
Directory Structure Overview: A brief explanation of the main folders (client/, server/, shared/, test/, migrations/, attached_assets/).
Deployment Notes (Optional for now, but good for later): Any specific instructions or considerations for deploying the application.
Contribution Guidelines (If applicable): How others (or your AI) should contribute, coding style, etc.
server/README.md

Purpose: Specific details about the backend/server-side part of the application.
Content Ideas:
Overview of the server architecture (Express, routes, services, adapters, queue).
Details on API authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Explanation of the queue system (BullMQ, Redis dependency, worker process).
Notes on environment variables specific to the server.
How to run server-specific tests if any (though your run-tests.sh seems to cover this).
Key service descriptions (e.g., AIService, BatchOperationsService).
client/README.md

Purpose: Specific details about the frontend/client-side part of the application.
Content Ideas:
Overview of the client architecture (React, Vite, React Query, TailwindCSS).
Notes on state management (React Query).
Information on the UI component library (Shadcn UI based on components.json) and styling approach.
How to run client-specific development tasks or tests if any (again, run-tests.sh likely covers tests).
Explanation of important directories within client/src/lib/ or client/src/hooks/.
.env.example File (Crucial for Setup)

Purpose: A template for the required .env file. It should list all necessary environment variables with placeholder or example values and brief comments explaining each.
Content (Example):
# Application
NODE_ENV=development # or production
PORT=5000

# Database (Neon/PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require"

# Session Management
SESSION_SECRET="a_very_strong_and_random_secret_key_for_sessions"
CSRF_SECRET="another_very_strong_and_random_secret_for_csrf"

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
# AI_MODEL_PROVIDER="openai" # or "gemini" (Example if you make it configurable)

# Redis for BullMQ (Optional for local dev if direct processing is used)
ENABLE_REDIS="false" # Set to "true" to enable Redis in dev
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
# Alternatively, use host/port:
# REDIS_HOST="localhost"
# REDIS_PORT="6379"
# REDIS_PASSWORD=""
# REDIS_USERNAME=""
# REDIS_DB="0"

# Add any other environment variables your application uses
